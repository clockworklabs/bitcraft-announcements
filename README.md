The <b>UI</b> received a complete overhaul we're aware of several bugs which haven't been fixed yet, feel free to report anything you find.
You currently can't split stacks of items, this is not intended.
Currently you can't click to move on the minimap.
The pre-alpha version of BitCraft has unfortunately no sound but this will change in the future.
<b>Keybindings</b> Can currently not be customized, our apologies.
We are aware of performance problems, some of the graphics is not optmized and there are some performance issues for some large UI windows (e.g. Compendium).
The ability to move items and cargo more easily is planned.
