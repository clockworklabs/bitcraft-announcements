The UI received a complete overhaul and some UI icons are still missing.
Pre-alpha 10 features fundamental biomes like forests, grasslands, mountains, and water areas but other announced biomes are not in this build.
Not all known travelers are active. Our apologies if your favorite is missing in this build. 
The pre-alpha version of BitCraft has unfortunately no sound but this will change in the future.
Can currently not be customized, our apologies.
